  <h1>Console Month</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    After several days of playing Half Life 2, I suffered severe simulator sickness. Whatever, I need some methods to spend my days coding instead of playing FPS games.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to experience the pure code environment in the 80s, and I decided to use FreeBSD without X to foucus on developing programs. Reading text manual pages and doing stuff in emacs really give me a chance to stay focused and learn througher than before. This month is so called "Console Month", and I'm going to take that challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    This challenge even brings extra benefits that I can practice my English because the text console dosen't support CJK fonts! Maybe someday I will figure out how to make FreeBSD kernel to support Chinese characters.
